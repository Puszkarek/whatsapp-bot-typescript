# Whatsapp-Bot

A little bot to automatize stickers creation and add some entertainment to groups.
I use this project to try a project folder structure that separates the files by they function, and not by they features. Initially, I use that structure on an Angular and works pretty nice, so this is my try to bring into backend and this is the result. (Still need some improvements)
